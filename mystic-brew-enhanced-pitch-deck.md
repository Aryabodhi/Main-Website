## THE BREWING SYSTEM

![Brewing System](/api/placeholder/500/300)

### Core Philosophy:
No recipe books. Discovery through experimentation. Results that feel both logical and magical.

### How It Works:
Every ingredient contains elemental properties that interact according to consistent rules:

- **Synergies:** Combining compatible elements enhances effects
- **Neutralizations:** Opposing elements cancel each other out
- **Instabilities:** Certain combinations create unpredictable outcomes

Players develop intuition about these interactions over time, becoming true alchemists who understand the fundamental laws of magic.
